## Description

5S.GIFT is a light web-app wallet accessed by a unique URL address. Just by clicking a link a user obtains the ability to spend wallet's balance with no sign-up, no login, no registration, no password or whatever. Although the link-wallet app has advanced options for users that wish to create multiple wallets and run commercial campaigns. The app offers users different modes and scenarios that could be applied to a big variety of private and commercial cases with excellent customization abilities and API methods.

## Modes and usage scenarios

### One wallet mode

<b>`Simple.`</b> The app creates a unique URL-wallet for a user. Anyone who knows the URL gets access to a balance. The user is able to attach a message or set a password to the link-wallet if they want. In this case, a recipient will need to know the URL and the password. Also, a user may customize the wallet by picking an envelope for it from the preset skins. All modes contain easy and wide sharing options.

<b>`Feedback.`</b> The scenario in which the wallet user, before gaining access to it, must leave some kind of feedback: review, opinion, suggestion, recommendation, consultation or other valuable information. After filling out the form and submitting it, the user gets access to the balance. The user's feedback is sent to the creator email 
address.

<b>`Action.`</b> In this scenario, the user must complete a task and fill out a form with proof of its completion before accessing the link-wallet. The task to be performed is described by the creator in the step of wallet generation. For example repost, like, comment, or other action. The result of the userâ€™s action is sent to the creator's email address.

* In One wallet mode, a link-wallet is sent from one user to another (one-to-one), which most likely implies the presence of acquaintance between the participants in the process, or the presence of a basic level of trust. Obviously, these cases do not require an advanced level of validation of actions, a useful action will be performed efficiently due to the mutual interest of the parties.

<b>One wallet mode functionality</b>

* Balance auto check & load
* Deeplink transaction functionality 
* Link-wallet password protection
* Customization skins
* Localization (languages, currencies)
* Extensive share options: native, QRs, copy buffer, direct target spending links, shares & QRs
* Balance spend: top-up mobile (<a href="https://biptophone.ru/apiuser.php" target="_blank">api options</a>), Time Loop game, charity fund
* Balance transfer (other addresses)
* Balance forwarding (new wallet-link generation) 


### Multiple wallet mode

A user has to sign-up and login to an account to be able to create multiple wallet campaigns. 
They will be offered to specify:

* A number of wallets to generate (fixed or unlimited)
* Wallets working scenario (simple or feedback)
* Indicate one wallet balance 
* Indicate target spending (completely flexible)
* Attach feedback request (in feedback mode)
* Pick up skins (in simple mode)
* Import email database to generate wallets for it
* Send wallets to imported email database
* Export or copy a generated list of link-wallets
* Track statistics

<b>Unlimited wallets:</b> 
This option allows a user to create an unlimited number of wallets through an API method:

`/api/company/uid/get_wallet?count=N` 

API request generates N number of wallets and returns them in JSON format. Please note, newly created wallets will have zero balances by default and will be credited only after a recipient's first visit.

<b>There are two scenarios to create multiple wallet campaigns:</b> 

<b>`Simple.`</b> Unique URL-wallets with easy access to them, just by clicking the link.

<b>`Feedback.`</b> Before accessing, users must leave feedback. For validation purposes, our solution has a developed api method, please check point <a href="https://github.com/MotherMinter/Push#5-beforeafter-activation">5 of an API documentation section</a>

* Please note the mechanics of creating an array of wallets that have been implemented.
The funds sent to deposit a campaign are initially credited to an intermediate address. The activation of individual wallets  (meaning depositing funds to the wallets) occurs only after a user visits a wallet link. This provides an ability to return unused funds to the campaign creator.

### Branded link-wallet

The branded URL feature has been implemented. 

<b>Examples</b>

`https://<your_host>/coffeyshop`

`https://<your_host>/barbershop`

Any other URL address from 6 to 64 characters will work fine. To generate a link-wallet a user needs to go by a branded link and input a password they want. After the password entrance, a URL-wallet is created in which the address for replenishing the balance is indicated. To access the balance the URL and the password needed.

## Security

The wallet app is implemented using light client technology, this approach ensures that a private key (and seed phrase) never leaves the user's end-device. The process of transaction creation and signing takes place in the application, after which the formed transactions are sent to the network through the server. A password that the user inputs during wallet creation is involved in private key generation, and not transmitted outside the application in an open way.

## UX & UI

For developing the app a clear and light design approach was adopted. 

* Clean modern design
* No visual barriers or distractions
* All app interface scenarios are decorated with meta-data, modal windows with prompts, place holders with examples to facilitate user navigation and interaction with the application
* Short link-wallets (6 characters, apart from a domain name)
* <a href="https://github.com/MotherMinter/Push/blob/master/www/static/Block_diagram_full.jpg" target="_blank">Full UI-design</a>

## Customization

There are two main directions for app customization, both of them are implemented in the project.

<b>`Branded stile.`</b> There is the ability to attach full-screen custom animation and a message to a wallet.

<b>`Target spending.`</b> A campaign creator is able to indicate target spending in a completely flexible way.

<b>Adding new skins</b>

<b>1.</b> Add skin stiles to `/www/pages/skin.js`
```
{
    id: 'starwars',
    label: 'STAR WARS',
    image: '',
    path: './skins/star-wars-day.html'
},
``` 

<b>2.</b> Create skin html. Template - `/www/static/skins/_skin-template.html`
Skin have to consist from - html, css, js.
